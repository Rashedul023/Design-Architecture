    "# SOLID Principles in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID is a set of five design principles.  \n",
    "These principles are followed to design **robust**, **testable**, **extensible**, and **maintainable** object-oriented software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each principle addresses a specific type of problem that might occur during software development.  \n",
    "By applying these principles, changes can be made to a codebase without causing major issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meaning of SOLID\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **SOLID** is an acronym for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S** – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  \n",
    "- **O** – Open-Closed Principle (OCP)  \n",
    "- **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  \n",
    "- **I** – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  \n",
    "- **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  \n",
    "\n",
    "These principles were introduced by **Robert C. Martin** (Uncle Bob) in the year 2000.  \n",
    "They form a subcategory of general software design principles, primarily applied in **object-oriented programming** but also useful in other programming approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of SOLID\n",
    "\n",
    "If these principles are ignored, **tight coupling** often occurs in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tight Coupling:** Classes depend heavily on one another, so a change in one class might break others.\n",
    "- **Loose Coupling:** Classes have minimal dependencies, making code:\n",
    "  - Easier to maintain  \n",
    "  - Easier to test  \n",
    "  - More reusable  \n",
    "  - More flexible and scalable  \n",
    "\n",
    "Loose coupling is considered a sign of good software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "A class should have **only one reason to change**.  \n",
    "This means each class should handle **only one responsibility**.  \n",
    "When multiple responsibilities are placed in a single class, changes to one responsibility can affect the others and create bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A person who is both a chef and a delivery driver may face problems when both tasks are needed at the same time.  \n",
    "Separating these tasks avoids conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "Software entities should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.  \n",
    "New features should be added without altering existing tested code.  \n",
    "This reduces the risk of introducing bugs into stable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A power strip can allow more devices to be connected without needing to rebuild the strip itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
    "Subclasses should be replaceable with their parent classes **without breaking the program**.  \n",
    "If a subclass changes the expected behavior, it violates this principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "If a bird-watching app is designed with the assumption that all birds can fly, adding an ostrich will cause problems because ostriches cannot fly.  \n",
    "Such cases require separate treatment for flying and non-flying birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
    "Clients should **not be forced** to depend on methods they do not use.  \n",
    "Instead of having one large interface, smaller and more specific interfaces should be created.  \n",
    "This allows classes to implement only the methods they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A printer that only prints should not be forced to include scanning or faxing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.  \n",
    "Both should depend on **abstractions** such as interfaces or abstract classes.  \n",
    "This makes it easy to swap components without changing the main logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A lamp can work with any type of bulb as long as it fits the socket. The lamp is not dependent on one specific bulb type.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Principle | Main Idea | Real-Life Example |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n",
    "| SRP | One class = one responsibility | Separate cook and delivery driver |\n",
    "| OCP | Extend without modifying | Add more plugs to a power strip |\n",
    "| LSP | Subtypes must behave like their base type | Flying vs non-flying birds |\n",
    "| ISP | Avoid forcing unused methods | Printer without scanner or fax |\n",
    "| DIP | Depend on abstractions | Any bulb in a lamp socket |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the SOLID principles results in:\n",
    "- Better-structured code\n",
    "- Easier maintenance and updates\n",
    "- Safer modifications without breaking unrelated features\n",
    "- A more stable and scalable system\n",
    "\n",
    "Although applying these principles might increase the size of the codebase initially, the long-term benefits include reduced bugs, greater flexibility, and higher overall quality.\n"

    "\n",
    "> **\"A class should have only one reason to change.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Every class should **focus on a single responsibility**.\n",
    "- A class should **do only one job or have one clear purpose** in the system.\n",
    "- If a class has **multiple responsibilities**, changes to one responsibility might accidentally affect the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems Without SRP:\n",
    "1. **Harder to Maintain** – If one change is made, unrelated functionality might break.\n",
    "2. **Difficult to Test** – Testing a class that handles multiple jobs becomes more complex.\n",
    "3. **Poor Readability** – It becomes unclear what the class is *really* for.\n",
    "4. **Tight Coupling** – Multiple functionalities are tangled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of SRP:\n",
    "1. **Easier Maintenance** – One change affects only the specific part of the code.\n",
    "2. **Better Testability** – Small, focused classes are easier to test.\n",
    "3. **Improved Reusability** – A class can be reused in different contexts without dragging extra, unrelated logic.\n",
    "4. **Better Collaboration** – Multiple developers can work on different parts of the system without conflicts.\n",

    "- Calculating total price  \n",
    "- Processing payment  \n",

    "|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Clear Separation of Concerns** | Order management and payment handling are distinctly separated, making the codebase more organized and easier to understand. |\n",
    "| **Easier Maintenance**       | Changes to payment logic (e.g., updating payment gateways) can be made without modifying order management code, reducing complexity. |\n",
    "| **Better Reusability**       | A standalone `PaymentProcessor` class can be reused across different order types, such as online, wholesale, or subscription orders. |\n",
    "| **Reduced Risk**             | Modifying payment-related code won’t inadvertently affect order management functionality, minimizing bugs. |\n",

    "| **Increased Complexity**     | Adding new payment methods (e.g., PayPal, cryptocurrency) bloats the `Order` class, making it harder to manage. |\n",
    "| **Higher Risk of Errors**    | Changes to the payment process can unintentionally break order management functionality. |\n",
    "| **Harder to Test**           | Mixing unrelated logic (order and payment) complicates unit testing, as tests must account for both responsibilities. |\n",
