    "# SOLID Principles in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID is a set of five design principles.  \n",
    "These principles are followed to design **robust**, **testable**, **extensible**, and **maintainable** object-oriented software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each principle addresses a specific type of problem that might occur during software development.  \n",
    "By applying these principles, changes can be made to a codebase without causing major issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meaning of SOLID\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **SOLID** is an acronym for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S** – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  \n",
    "- **O** – Open-Closed Principle (OCP)  \n",
    "- **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  \n",
    "- **I** – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  \n",
    "- **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  \n",
    "\n",
    "These principles were introduced by **Robert C. Martin** (Uncle Bob) in the year 2000.  \n",
    "They form a subcategory of general software design principles, primarily applied in **object-oriented programming** but also useful in other programming approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of SOLID\n",
    "\n",
    "If these principles are ignored, **tight coupling** often occurs in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tight Coupling:** Classes depend heavily on one another, so a change in one class might break others.\n",
    "- **Loose Coupling:** Classes have minimal dependencies, making code:\n",
    "  - Easier to maintain  \n",
    "  - Easier to test  \n",
    "  - More reusable  \n",
    "  - More flexible and scalable  \n",
    "\n",
    "Loose coupling is considered a sign of good software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "A class should have **only one reason to change**.  \n",
    "This means each class should handle **only one responsibility**.  \n",
    "When multiple responsibilities are placed in a single class, changes to one responsibility can affect the others and create bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A person who is both a chef and a delivery driver may face problems when both tasks are needed at the same time.  \n",
    "Separating these tasks avoids conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "Software entities should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.  \n",
    "New features should be added without altering existing tested code.  \n",
    "This reduces the risk of introducing bugs into stable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A power strip can allow more devices to be connected without needing to rebuild the strip itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
    "Subclasses should be replaceable with their parent classes **without breaking the program**.  \n",
    "If a subclass changes the expected behavior, it violates this principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "If a bird-watching app is designed with the assumption that all birds can fly, adding an ostrich will cause problems because ostriches cannot fly.  \n",
    "Such cases require separate treatment for flying and non-flying birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
    "Clients should **not be forced** to depend on methods they do not use.  \n",
    "Instead of having one large interface, smaller and more specific interfaces should be created.  \n",
    "This allows classes to implement only the methods they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A printer that only prints should not be forced to include scanning or faxing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.  \n",
    "Both should depend on **abstractions** such as interfaces or abstract classes.  \n",
    "This makes it easy to swap components without changing the main logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Real-Life):**  \n",
    "A lamp can work with any type of bulb as long as it fits the socket. The lamp is not dependent on one specific bulb type.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Principle | Main Idea | Real-Life Example |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n",
    "| SRP | One class = one responsibility | Separate cook and delivery driver |\n",
    "| OCP | Extend without modifying | Add more plugs to a power strip |\n",
    "| LSP | Subtypes must behave like their base type | Flying vs non-flying birds |\n",
    "| ISP | Avoid forcing unused methods | Printer without scanner or fax |\n",
    "| DIP | Depend on abstractions | Any bulb in a lamp socket |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the SOLID principles results in:\n",
    "- Better-structured code\n",
    "- Easier maintenance and updates\n",
    "- Safer modifications without breaking unrelated features\n",
    "- A more stable and scalable system\n",
    "\n",
    "Although applying these principles might increase the size of the codebase initially, the long-term benefits include reduced bugs, greater flexibility, and higher overall quality.\n"

    "> **\"A class should have only one reason to change.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Every class should **focus on a single responsibility**.\n",
    "- A class should **do only one job or have one clear purpose** in the system.\n",
    "- If a class has **multiple responsibilities**, changes to one responsibility might accidentally affect the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems Without SRP:\n",
    "1. **Harder to Maintain** – If one change is made, unrelated functionality might break.\n",
    "2. **Difficult to Test** – Testing a class that handles multiple jobs becomes more complex.\n",
    "3. **Poor Readability** – It becomes unclear what the class is *really* for.\n",
    "4. **Tight Coupling** – Multiple functionalities are tangled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of SRP:\n",
    "1. **Easier Maintenance** – One change affects only the specific part of the code.\n",
    "2. **Better Testability** – Small, focused classes are easier to test.\n",
    "3. **Improved Reusability** – A class can be reused in different contexts without dragging extra, unrelated logic.\n",
    "4. **Better Collaboration** – Multiple developers can work on different parts of the system without conflicts.\n",

    "It states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "In formal terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If Φ(x) is a property provable about objects `x` of type `T`,  \n",
    "> then Φ(y) should be true for objects `y` of type `S` where `S` is a subtype of `T`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subclass must behave in a way that **does not violate expectations** set by its superclass.  \n",
    "- The client code should **not need to know whether it is dealing with a superclass or subclass**; both must behave consistently.  \n",
    "- The LSP enforces **behavioral compatibility**, not just structural compatibility.\n",

    "|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Consistency**                | Subclasses behave in line with the superclass, avoiding surprises. |\n",
    "| **Reliability**                 | Programs remain correct when a subclass object is used in place of a superclass object. |\n",
    "| **Reusability**                 | Code can be reused without modification since subclasses can be swapped easily. |\n",

    "   - Subclasses may relax restrictions, but not enforce stricter ones.\n",
    "2. **Return Types** – Return values of subclasses must be compatible with the parent’s return type.  \n",
    "   - A subclass may return a subtype, but never something unrelated.\n",
    "3. **Behavioral Consistency** – Subclasses must preserve the expected behavior of the parent.  \n",
    "4. **No Weakened Invariants** – Subclasses must maintain class invariants defined in the parent.  \n",

    "   - The `Tea` class incorrectly inherits from `Coffee`.  \n",
    "   - Tea is not a type of coffee, yet it is treated as one due to inheritance.  \n",
    "   - Client code that expects a `Coffee` object may encounter **unexpected behavior** or **incorrect output** if a `Tea` instance is substituted.  \n",
    "   - This design **violates LSP**, making the system fragile and harder to maintain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **With LSP:**  \n",
    "   - A common **abstract base class `Beverage`** is introduced.  \n",
    "   - Coffee and Tea hierarchies are separated under this abstraction.  \n",
    "   - Client code interacts only with `Beverage` objects and does not need to know the specific type.  \n",
    "   - Any subclass (Espresso, Cappuccino, GreenTea, BlackTea) can safely replace its parent abstraction without affecting program correctness.  \n",
